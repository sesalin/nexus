/**
 * Fetch entity source metadata with short-lived in-memory caching.
 *
 * Caching strategy:
 * - Keyed under the internal cache id `"_entitySources"`.
 * - TTL: 30 seconds; after this the data is considered stale and refetched.
 * - Invalidation heuristic: number of entity states (Object.keys(hass.states).length).
 *   If the count changes between fetches before TTL expiry we assume entity additions/removals and force refresh.
 *
 * This heuristic is intentionally coarse to avoid deep diffs of the state map: additions/removals/change in total count
 * usually correlate with potential integration changes, which might imply different source mapping.
 *
 * Edge Cases & Considerations:
 * - If an integration reload swaps domains without changing entity count, the cache will NOT invalidate early. Such
 *   scenarios are rare; manual cache busting can be added if required.
 * - For extremely large installations consider extending TTL to reduce websocket chatter further; domain provenance
 *   rarely changes often.
 * - If entity states oscillate (rapid add/remove) the cache may invalidate frequently; debouncing at a higher layer
 *   could mitigate performance concerns.
 *
 * @param hassEntities Current HassEntities map used solely for the size heuristic.
 * @param connection Active HA websocket connection.
 * @returns Promise resolving to the (possibly cached) entity sources mapping.
