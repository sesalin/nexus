/**
 * The CameraCard is a card to display a live stream, poster image that refreshes at a specified interval or a motion jpeg stream.
 *
 * By Default, it will load a poster image and refresh it at a specified interval, if you want to use the live stream you can set the view to live or motion.
 *
 * This supports HLS, WebRTC and MJPEG streams, the WebRTC implementation hasn't been tested so if you're using WebRTC and it's not working for you please create an [issue request](https://github.com/shannonhochkins/ha-component-kit/issues).
 *
 * It also supports additional entities to render on the card such is motion detection, vehicle detection if you have entities that have additional data you can display them in the card easily.
 *
 * This is one of the first components that i have NOT got a complete demo working, as you can imagine setting up a live stream, motion image and refreshable poster image is a difficult and time expensive task, so you'll have to try it out to explore it's wonders :)
 *
 * Note: If you want to just use the stream, you can also import CameraStream from @hakit/components to use the stream as a video player element.
